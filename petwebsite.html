    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Loved Pets Animal Shelter is a project to create a single-page website for an animal shelter charity.
The project is divided into six distinct design stages, research, plan, design, and the overall website. This is
      based on the clients needs and wants for the animal shelter charity and a way to attract users into
      adopting a pet.</p>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>The main deliverable for the project is creating a website for the animal shelter. Which means that the website should connect to people emotionally and have a connection so people can adopt pets. This would provide adoption information, volunteer information, and the shelter's information. 
The website believes all animals deserve a chance to find a loving forever home. 
      The client wants people to adopt animals in the shelter and provide a home and love to those animals. Another want is having volunteers to help care and work in the shelter.  </p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>The client wanted a website for the animal shelter. Before I created the website, I had to think about the target audience and the layout of the app.
      This is by empathizing the user and client needs. </p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Position of images and texts</li>
    </ul>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>I used many resources to help me with the postition of images like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3schools</a> and I used codepen to see my progress and changes in the website</p>
