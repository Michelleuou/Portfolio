    <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>NYC Connect Us was created by a group that consisted of 5 members. The app was created for families who has lost contact with their loved ones.
   There can be various reasons for a family member to go missing and lose contact of each other. 
   Families can use the app to reunite and find their missing family member. </p>
  <h3>Goal</h3>
  <p>The goal of our app is to help families reunite with their missing loved ones this is by partnering with organizations, 
    the community, and law enforcement.</p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Before we created the app and came to the conclusion to this issue, we first had the idea to create an app surrounding about homelessness in America. 
      However, with many constructive criticism and discussing within the group, we made a decision to go with missing people. 
      We wanted to focus on a smaller aspect of our target audience in New York City while focusing on a world social issue. </p>
