    <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>NYC Connect Us was created by a group that consisted of 5 members. Tanzina, Jaylen, Jennifer, Adam, and myself included. The group worked with 2 mentors to help with the app project. 
    The app was created for families who has lost contact with their loved ones.
   There can be various reasons for a family member to go missing and lose contact of each other. 
   Families can use the app to reunite and find their missing family member. The soical issue we focused on was missing people/person in New York cities.
   Families can be separated due to various reasons. Many of these reasons can be kidnapping, natural disaters, 
   or families simply losing conatct with a family member.
</p>
  <h3>Goal</h3>
  <p>The goal of our app is to help families reunite with their missing loved ones this is by partnering with organizations, 
    the community, and law enforcement. We wanted our app to be user friendly and provided necessary resources
  to the families and the missing person.</p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Before we created the app and came to the conclusion to this issue, we first had the idea to create an app surrounding about homelessness in America. 
      We researched homelessness but we had diffcult ways to solve this with an app. As we focued on homelessness around the world.
      However, with many constructive criticism and discussion within the group, we made a decision to go with missing people.
      We wanted to focus on a smaller aspect of our target audience which is in New York City while focusing on a world social issue that
      need to be solved. 
    </p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Focusing on a target audience</li>
<li>Creating our app prototype/design</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>During our brainstorm, we focused on a big majority of the world. This made it diffcult to create an app for everyone's 
      needs. Especially since we focused on homelessness as our social issue. We made the decision to focus on New York City and 
      Missing people as a social issue. While creating out app design, we had difficulty having so much features. So we combined the features
      together to make it easier for users to use the app and so that the app isn't overwhelming to users. 
    </p>
  <h3>After Thought</h3>
  <p>The app was submitted to the Emoticon Mouse Challenge in 2024. Many month of working and creating this app, the app won
  for the Design Thinking award.</p>
