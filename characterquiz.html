  <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>This is a project where I create a website of a character quiz. I used Delatrune, a game to create my character quiz. I used
        4 character, Kris, Susie, Berdly, and Ralsei
       While creating my character quiz, I'm suppose to use conditional statements to show which character 
       the user has gotten after submitting the quiz.
      </p>
      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>The goal was to use conditiona statements in JQuery and understanding conditional statements in my code.</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>After all conditions weren't met in the code, the should show a dog.
      However, the dog kept appearing along with the other character.</li>
      <li>The conditional statements were very disorganized and sepreated on it own block</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>I figured that the dog should be as shown by default to the code, as well as putting
      the dog into a else statment. This way the dog iss able to be shown when conditions aren't met and
      doesn't overlap other character's shown.</p>
      <p>I combined each character into one block and put them in a else if statement. 
      This way the code is more readable. Also this took a big chunk of unnecesscary code in my if statement.</p>
