      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Cloud Closet is an app for people who find it difficult to decide on what to wear that is appropriate for the weather of the day. 
    It provides weather forecasts, gives outfit recommendations based on the weather, and allows users to mix and match their existing clothes. 
    The app was created by two people. I collaborated with my colleague Jennifer. The apps main focus was our 
    closet and chatbot feature Ruki.</p>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p> Our target audience for our app is students and adults that need outfit suggestions based on weather.
        The goal of our app was to help students and adults who travel for work and school. As weather can be
        unpredicatble and sometimes people don't know what to wear for the day. Our app lets users
        choose an appropriate outfit for the weather while also letting people have their style of clothing.</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>When we were brainstorming app ideas, we researched the tiny problems in our daily lives and 
      heard someone said that they were having trouble deciding what to wear for the day. 
      So we decided to create an app that helps this situation. We also considered having a weather forecast in the
      app to provide appropriate outfit recommendations.</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Coding the Ruki Feature in our app</li>
        <li>Learning a new programming langauge</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      <p>While we faced those challenges we used resources to help code our app feature such as 
        Youtube and a guide into learning the program. We needed to understand the programming and 
        create our chatbot Ruki.</p>
